If it involves electrons, I&Atilde;&cent;&acirc;&sbquo;&not;&acirc;&bdquo;&cent;m interested. </p>
<p>I have ~13 years of industry experience and have led several large-scale engagements for Fortune 50 companies through full project life-cycles.</p>
<p>I've spent the last 5 years on Wall Street where in my day job I design&#47;architect software systems for a large financial firm and lead a UI Framework team. </p>
<p>I&Atilde;&cent;&acirc;&sbquo;&not;&acirc;&bdquo;&cent;ve written a bunch of articles which&Atilde;&cent;&acirc;&sbquo;&not;&acirc;&bdquo;&cent;ve been published in both Paper and Online media including Microsoft&Atilde;&cent;&acirc;&sbquo;&not;&acirc;&bdquo;&cent;s MSDN website. I&Atilde;&cent;&acirc;&sbquo;&not;&acirc;&bdquo;&cent;ve developed software from every angle, product and project development including framework development. I&Atilde;&cent;&acirc;&sbquo;&not;&acirc;&bdquo;&cent;m also a pretty good facilitator.</p>
<p>In 2007 I wrote a book on web services, Ajax, JSON and Mashups entitled Amazon.com Mashups which you can find on Amazon.</p>
