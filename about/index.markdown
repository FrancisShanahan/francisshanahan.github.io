Currently VP of Engineering at Audible.com - these are my personal postings, mostly on running/endurance events and the occasional comment on software development. 

I work for [http://Audible.com](http://Audible.com) which is a part of Amazon and we are always hiring. If you're software developer looking for a great place to work I'd love to hear from you.
